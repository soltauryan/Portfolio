# What are Unsupervised Neural Networks?

Unsupervised Neural Networks are a class of neural networks used in unsupervised learning, where the training data is not labeled. These networks are designed to identify patterns, features, or structures in the input data without explicit guidance. Common types of unsupervised neural networks include self-organizing maps (SOMs), autoencoders, and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). They are primarily used for clustering, dimensionality reduction, feature learning, and generative tasks.

## Types of Business Questions Answered

Unsupervised Neural Networks can be leveraged to address various analytical and business questions, such as:

- **Customer Segmentation:** Can we group customers based on purchasing behavior or preferences without pre-defined categories?
- **Anomaly Detection:** How can we identify unusual patterns or outliers in transaction data?
- **Feature Extraction:** What are the underlying features in a dataset that explain the most variance?
- **Generative Modeling:** Can we generate new data samples that are similar to our original dataset?

## Types of Data Input

Unsupervised Neural Networks can process different types of data, including:

- **Image Data:** For tasks like image compression, denoising, or generating new images.
- **Text Data:** For natural language understanding, topic modeling, or text generation.
- **Numerical or Tabular Data:** For clustering or finding patterns in datasets with many features.

## Useful Visuals and Metrics

Effective visuals and metrics for Unsupervised Neural Networks include:

- **Cluster Maps:** Visualizing the clustering of data, often used with SOMs.
- **Reconstruction Error:** A metric for autoencoders that measures how well the input data is reconstructed.
- **Generated Samples:** Visual inspection of data samples generated by networks like GANs.
- **t-SNE or PCA Plots:** For visualizing high-dimensional data in lower dimensions.

## Small Python Example

Here is an example of an autoencoder, a type of unsupervised neural network, using Pythonâ€™s TensorFlow and Keras libraries:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.datasets import load_digits

# Load dataset
digits = load_digits()
X = digits.data

# Splitting dataset
X_train, X_test = train_test_split(X, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Building the autoencoder
model = Sequential()
model.add(Dense(64, input_dim=64, activation='relu'))
model.add(Dense(32, activation='relu'))
model.add(Dense(64, activation='relu'))
model.add(Dense(64, activation='sigmoid'))

# Compiling the model
model.compile(loss='binary_crossentropy', optimizer='adam')

# Training the model
model.fit(X_train, X_train, epochs=100, batch_size=256, validation_data=(X_test, X_test))

# The model now can be used to encode or decode data
