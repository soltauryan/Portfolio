# What are Linear Mixed Models (LMMs)?

Linear Mixed Models (LMMs) are a type of statistical model used to analyze data that contains both fixed and random effects. These models are particularly useful when dealing with hierarchical or grouped data, and in situations where data points are not independent of each other. LMMs help in understanding both the population-average effects (fixed effects) and the random effects due to individual differences or specific group characteristics.

## Types of Business Questions Answered

LMMs are versatile and can be used to answer various business and research questions, including:

- **Longitudinal Data Analysis:** How do variables change over time within individuals or groups?
- **Multi-level Marketing:** What are the effects of marketing strategies at different levels (e.g., region, store, individual)?
- **Educational Research:** How do student outcomes vary across schools and within schools over time?
- **Healthcare Studies:** What are the effects of treatments considering patient variability?

## Types of Data Input

Linear Mixed Models can handle a variety of data types, such as:

- **Hierarchical or Grouped Data:** Data that is organized into different levels or groups (e.g., students within schools).
- **Longitudinal Data:** Data collected from the same subjects over time.
- **Repeated Measures:** Data where multiple measurements are taken on each subject.

## Useful Visuals and Metrics

Key visuals and metrics for LMMs include:

- **Random Effects Distribution:** Visualizing the variation of random effects across groups or subjects.
- **Fixed Effects Coefficients:** Assessing the impact of fixed variables in the model.
- **Residual Plots:** To check for the assumptions of linearity and homoscedasticity.
- **Model Comparison Metrics:** AIC (Akaike Information Criterion) or BIC (Bayesian Information Criterion) for comparing different LMMs.

## Small Python Example

Here's an example of how to fit a Linear Mixed Model using Python's `statsmodels` library:

```python
import statsmodels.api as sm
import statsmodels.formula.api as smf
import pandas as pd

# Example dataset
data = pd.DataFrame({
    'response': [1, 2, 3, 4, 5],
    'predictor': [2, 4, 6, 8, 10],
    'group': ['A', 'A', 'B', 'B', 'B']
})

# Fitting the Linear Mixed Model
model = smf.mixedlm("response ~ predictor", data, groups=data["group"])
result = model.fit()

# Output the summary
print(result.summary())
