# What are Generalized Linear Models (GLMs)?

Generalized Linear Models (GLMs) are an extension of traditional linear models that allow for response variables to have error distribution models other than a normal distribution. GLMs are used in various statistical modeling and data analysis situations. They are particularly useful when the relationship between the response variable and predictors is not a linear function. GLMs consist of three components: the random component (distribution of the response variable), the systematic component (linear predictor), and the link function (connects the response to the linear predictor).

## Types of Business Questions Answered

GLMs can be applied to a wide array of business and research questions, such as:

- **Risk Assessment:** Calculating insurance premiums based on risk factors.
- **Credit Scoring:** Predicting the probability of default for credit applications.
- **Market Research:** Analyzing customer purchasing behavior and preferences.
- **Healthcare Analysis:** Examining patient outcomes based on treatment and risk factors.

## Types of Data Input

Generalized Linear Models can handle various types of data:

- **Binary Data:** For logistic regression models (e.g., yes/no outcomes).
- **Count Data:** For Poisson regression models (e.g., count of occurrences).
- **Continuous Data:** For normal linear models with non-linear relationships.
- **Categorical Data:** Can be included as predictors in the models.

## Useful Visuals and Metrics

Some useful visuals and metrics for GLMs include:

- **Residual Plots:** To check the assumption of the linear relationship between predictors and response.
- **Coefficient Plot:** Visualizing the impact of each predictor.
- **Confusion Matrix:** For classification models to evaluate performance.
- **AIC (Akaike Information Criterion):** For model selection and comparison.

## Small Python Example

Below is a simple example using Python's `statsmodels` library to implement a GLM:

```python
import statsmodels.api as sm
import pandas as pd

# Example dataset
data = pd.DataFrame({
    'x1': [1, 2, 3, 4, 5],
    'y': [0, 1, 0, 1, 1]
})

# Defining the predictor and response variables
X = data[['x1']]
y = data['y']

# Adding a constant to the model (intercept)
X = sm.add_constant(X)

# GLM with binomial family (logistic regression)
glm_binom = sm.GLM(y, X, family=sm.families.Binomial())
result = glm_binom.fit()

# Output the summary
print(result.summary())
