## Data Description

The data was gathered from the [Pushshift Reddit dataset](https://www.reddit.com/r/pushshift/comments/1akrhg3/separate_dump_files_for_the_top_40k_subreddits/). There are three datasets used in this analysis:

-**MN Vikings Records**: Contains historical performance data of the Minnesota Vikings team.

## Methodology

The analysis involves several steps:

1.**Data Loading**: Load the raw datasets using R libraries.

2.**Data Cleaning**: Remove outliers and add useful columns like the football season.

3.**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Summarize and visualize the data to understand its structure and key characteristics.

4.**Text Mining**: Perform sentiment analysis and topic modeling to uncover themes and sentiments in the posts and comments.
