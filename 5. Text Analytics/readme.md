# What is Text Analytics?

Text Analytics, also known as text mining, involves using algorithms to analyze and process text data for extracting meaningful insights and information. It encompasses a range of techniques from basic keyword searching and frequency counts to more complex processes like sentiment analysis, topic modeling, and natural language processing (NLP). Text analytics is used to uncover patterns and trends, extract key information, and transform unstructured text into structured data that can be further analyzed.

## Types of Business Questions Answered

Text Analytics can help address various types of questions, including:

- **Customer Feedback Analysis:** What are the common themes in customer reviews and feedback?
- **Sentiment Analysis:** What is the sentiment (positive, negative, neutral) expressed in social media posts or customer feedback?
- **Document Classification:** How can we automatically categorize a large number of documents into predefined categories?
- **Trend Analysis:** What topics are trending over time in news articles or social media?

## Types of Data Input

Text Analytics can be applied to any form of textual data:

- **Social Media Posts:** Tweets, Facebook posts, or any other form of social media content.
- **Customer Reviews:** Feedback and reviews from e-commerce platforms or service portals.
- **Corporate Documents:** Internal documents, reports, or emails.
- **Online Content:** News articles, blogs, or any web-based textual content.

## Useful Visuals and Metrics

Useful visuals and metrics in Text Analytics include:

- **Word Clouds:** Visual representation of word frequency or importance in the text.
- **Sentiment Scores:** Quantitative measures of sentiment expressed in the text.
- **Topic Distribution:** Visualization of topic prevalence in a corpus of documents.
- **Frequency Distribution:** Counts or histograms of specific words or phrases.

## Small Python Example

Here's an example of basic text analytics using Python's NLTK library:

```python
import nltk
from nltk.corpus import stopwords
from wordcloud import WordCloud
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Sample text data
text = "Text analytics is a fascinating field of study. It involves extracting useful information from text."

# Tokenization and stopwords removal
words = nltk.word_tokenize(text)
words = [word for word in words if word.lower() not in stopwords.words('english')]

# Creating a WordCloud
wordcloud = WordCloud(width = 800, height = 800, background_color ='white').generate(' '.join(words))

# Displaying the WordCloud
plt.imshow(wordcloud)
plt.axis("off")
plt.show()
