## ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! I'm Ryan Soltau

As an aspiring Data Scientist, I thrive on transforming complex data into meaningful insights that drive business decisions. Recently completed my MS in Business Analytics, I combine analytical expertise, programming proficiency, and a passion for data-driven solutions to uncover actionable insights from data.

With a blend of technical skills and a business-oriented mindset, I aim to bridge the gap between raw data and impactful decision-making.

## Projects

I'm actively expanding my portfolio with projects that challenge and grow my skill set. Here are some current initiatives:

### 1. **MNIST ConvNet Implementation & Network Optimization**

Developed a convolutional neural network (ConvNet) model on the MNIST dataset, achieving a 99.3% accuracy rate. I further explored the modelâ€™s weights and biases to gain deeper insights into network architecture and performance.

### 2. **ChatGPT Dungeon Master for Space Adventure**

Created a command-line game where players navigate a starship across the galaxy, facing random scenarios generated by ChatGPT (at a higher temperature setting) to create dynamic, unpredictable challenges.

### 3. A/B Testing and Sentiment Analysis (Ongoing)

* Conducting an A/B testing project to evaluate product changes.
* Performing sentiment analysis on comments from the Minnesota Vikings subreddit to track fan emotions and trends (SKOL).

### 4. Beer Sales Regression and Classification

Developed regression and classification models to analyze beer sales data, predicting sales channels and spend per trip. Utilized Python and R for data processing, visualization, and model building, achieving significant insights into sales patterns and customer behavior.

* Data Cleaning and Preparation: Loaded and preprocessed beer sales data to ensure quality and consistency.
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualized data to uncover patterns and relationships, aiding in feature engineering.
* Model Building: Trained decision tree, support vector classifier, Lasso regression, and neural network models to predict sales outcomes.
* Model Evaluation: Assessed model performance using metrics like accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, precision, RMSE, MAE, and R-squared.
* Feature Engineering: Created new features to enhance model performance, including binary columns for weekend/weekday and categorized spend per trip.

This project showcases my ability to handle real-world data, perform comprehensive analysis, and build predictive models that provide actionable business insights.
