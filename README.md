## ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! I'm Ryan Soltau

As an aspiring Data Scientist, I thrive on transforming complex data into meaningful insights that drive business decisions. Recently completed my MS in Business Analytics, I combine analytical expertise, programming proficiency, and a passion for data-driven solutions to uncover actionable insights from data.

With a blend of technical skills and a business-oriented mindset, I aim to bridge the gap between raw data and impactful decision-making.

## Projects

I'm actively expanding my portfolio with projects that challenge and grow my skill set. Here are some current initiatives:

### 1. **MNIST ConvNet Implementation & Network Optimization**

Developed a convolutional neural network (ConvNet) model on the MNIST dataset, achieving a 99.3% accuracy rate. I further explored the modelâ€™s weights and biases to gain deeper insights into network architecture and performance.

### 2. **ChatGPT Dungeon Master for Space Adventure**

Created a command-line game where players navigate a starship across the galaxy, facing random scenarios generated by ChatGPT (at a higher temperature setting) to create dynamic, unpredictable challenges.

### 3. **A/B Testing and Sentiment Analysis** (Ongoing)

- Conducting an A/B testing project to evaluate product changes.
- Performing sentiment analysis on comments from the Minnesota Vikings subreddit to track fan emotions and trends (SKOL).
